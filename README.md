# -OpenCV-in-order-to-capture-frames
A server that is receiving a video stream from a client. The clients can view the video stream through a WebSocket at ws://1.2.3.4:8888. Now, I would like to use OpenCV in order to capture frames from that stream. You have to find a way to read (in Python) frame-by-frame the stream that is available through WebSocket?
